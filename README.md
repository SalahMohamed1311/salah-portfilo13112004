# CreativePro â€” Animated Split Package

Files:
- index.html
- styles.css
- app.js
- assets/ (wave.svg + placeholder webp images)

How to use:
1. Download and unzip the package.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview.
3. Replace files in `assets/` with your optimized WebP or SVG assets.
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel by uploading repo/folder.

Notes:
- The placeholders for images are empty files by default; replace them with real images (WebP recommended).
- The animated blobs are drawn by `app.js` into `#blobCanvas`.
- To slow animations, adjust --slow in styles.css and change animation timing in app.js.

Enjoy!
